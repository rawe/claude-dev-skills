# CLI Agent Runner Skill

## Intro

This skill provides guidance on using the `cli-agent-runner.sh` script to delegate work to Claude Code sessions.

Use this when you need to:
- Delegate a task to a specialized session for long-running operations
- Resume tasks later using a simple session name (no session ID management needed)
- Run sessions in the background with polling support
- Get clean result output without manual JSON parsing
- Optionally use agent definitions for specialized behavior

**Key Benefits:**
- Session names instead of session IDs (simpler to track and resume)
- Automatic session file management in `.cli-agent-runner/agent-sessions/` directory
- Built-in result extraction (no need for head/tail/jq commands)
- Clean output to stdout, errors to stderr
- Optional agent associations for specialized capabilities

## Terminology

- **Session**: A named, running conversation with Claude Code
- **Agent**: A reusable configuration/definition that provides specialized behavior for sessions
- **Session Name**: The unique identifier you give to a conversation (e.g., `architect`, `reviewer`)
- **Agent Name**: The identifier for a reusable agent definition (e.g., `system-architect`, `security-reviewer`)

## Variables

The following variables are used in the commands and instructions:

- `<session-name>`: A unique identifier for the session (alphanumeric, dash, underscore only; max 30 chars)
- `<agent-name>`: Optional agent definition to use for the session
- `<initial-prompt>`: The prompt or task description for a new session
- `<resume-prompt>`: The prompt or task description to continue an existing session's work
- `<POLL_INTERVAL>`: The interval in seconds to wait between polling attempts. Default is 60 seconds.

## Script Location

**IMPORTANT:** The `cli-agent-runner.sh` script is located in the same directory as this SKILL.md file.

Before using the script for the first time in a conversation, you MUST locate it:

1. Use the Glob tool to find the script: `pattern: "**/cli-agent-runner/cli-agent-runner.sh"`
2. Use the absolute path returned by Glob in all subsequent commands
3. Store this path mentally for the rest of the conversation

**Example:**
```bash
# After using Glob to find: /path/to/plugins/cli-agent-runner/cli-agent-runner.sh
# Use that exact path in all commands:
/path/to/plugins/cli-agent-runner/cli-agent-runner.sh new <session-name> -p "<prompt>"
```

**Note:** In all examples below, `cli-agent-runner.sh` represents the absolute path you discovered using Glob. Replace it with the actual path when executing commands.

## Commands Overview

The cli-agent-runner.sh supports five commands:

1. **new** - Create a new session (optionally with an agent)
2. **resume** - Resume an existing session by name
3. **list** - List all sessions with their session IDs
4. **list-agents** - List all available agent definitions
5. **clean** - Remove all sessions

## Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Synchronous Execution (Wait for Completion)

Use this when you want to wait for the session to complete and get the result immediately.

**Creating a new session:**
```bash
./cli-agent-runner.sh new <session-name> -p "<initial-prompt>"
```

**Creating a new session with an agent:**
```bash
./cli-agent-runner.sh new <session-name> --agent <agent-name> -p "<initial-prompt>"
```

**Creating a new session with prompt from file/stdin:**

This should be considered when the prompt is large or complex or already a prompt file exists potentially created by another session.

```bash
cat prompt.md | ./cli-agent-runner.sh new <session-name>
```

**Resuming an existing session:**
```bash
./cli-agent-runner.sh resume <session-name> -p "<resume-prompt>"
```

**Example:**
```bash
# Create new session with agent
./cli-agent-runner.sh new architect --agent system-architect -p "Create a high-level architecture document for a user authentication system"

# The script blocks until completion and outputs the result
# Output: <result from session>

# Resume the session later (agent association is remembered)
./cli-agent-runner.sh resume architect -p "Add API endpoint specifications to the architecture"
```

### Pattern 2: Background Execution with Polling

Use this when you want to start the session in the background and poll for completion.

**Instructions:**

**1. Start the session in the background:**
- Use Bash tool with `run_in_background: true`
- Use either `new` or `resume` command
- **Important:** Note the bash_id returned by the Bash tool

**Example for new session:**
```bash
./cli-agent-runner.sh new <session-name> -p "<initial-prompt>"
```

**Example for new session with agent:**
```bash
./cli-agent-runner.sh new <session-name> --agent <agent-name> -p "<initial-prompt>"
```

**Example for resuming session:**
```bash
./cli-agent-runner.sh resume <session-name> -p "<resume-prompt>"
```

**2. Initial Polling Wait:**
- Use Bash tool (NOT background): `sleep <POLL_INTERVAL>`
- Default POLL_INTERVAL is 60 seconds

**3. Check if background process is still running:**
- Use BashOutput tool with the bash_id from step 1
- The tool returns shell status showing if process is running or completed
- If status shows still running: continue to step 4
- If status shows completed: continue to step 5
- **Do NOT use:** kill -0, pgrep, ps, or any other process checking commands

**4. Polling Wait Loop:**
- Use Bash tool (NOT background): `sleep <POLL_INTERVAL>`
- Return to step 3

**5. Process Completed - Get Results:**
- The result is already captured in the Bash tool's output when the process completes
- Simply read the output from the completed Bash execution
- The output will be the session's result (already extracted by the script)

**Full Background Example:**
```bash
# Step 1: Start in background
./cli-agent-runner.sh new architect --agent system-architect -p "Design authentication system"
# Returns bash_id: abc123

# Step 2: Initial wait
sleep 60

# Step 3: Check status
# Use BashOutput with bash_id: abc123
# If status: running, continue to step 4
# If status: completed, read the output - it contains the result

# Step 4: If still running, wait and check again
sleep 60
# Return to step 3
```

### Pattern 3: Listing Sessions

Use this to see all existing sessions and their status.

```bash
./cli-agent-runner.sh list
```

**Output format:**
```
session-name (session: session-id)
architect (session: 3db5dca9-6829-4cb7-a645-c64dbd98244d)
reviewer (session: initializing)
```

- "initializing" means the session file exists but hasn't started yet (empty file)
- "unknown" means the session ID couldn't be extracted
- Otherwise, shows the actual session ID

### Pattern 4: Listing Available Agent Definitions

Use this to discover what agent definitions are available before creating a session.

```bash
./cli-agent-runner.sh list-agents
```

**Output format:**
```
agent-name:
description

---

next-agent-name:
description

---

another-agent-name:
description
```

**Example output:**
```
code-reviewer:
Reviews code for best practices, bugs, and potential improvements

---

documentation-writer:
Creates comprehensive technical documentation and guides

---

system-architect:
Expert in designing scalable system architectures
```

**Use Case:**
- Discover available agents before creating a new session
- Understand what specialized capabilities are available
- Choose the appropriate agent for your task

**Important Notes:**
- Each agent definition is separated by `---` for clear parsing
- Agent names can be used with `--agent` flag when creating sessions
- If no agents exist, outputs: "No agent definitions found"

### Pattern 5: Cleaning All Sessions

Use this to remove all sessions and start fresh.

```bash
./cli-agent-runner.sh clean
```

**Behavior:**
- Removes the entire `.cli-agent-runner/agent-sessions/` directory
- All session files and history are permanently deleted
- No confirmation prompt - immediate deletion
- Safe to run even if no sessions exist

**Output:**
```
All sessions removed
```
or
```
No sessions to remove
```

## Prompt Input Methods

The script supports flexible prompt input:

1. **Via `-p` flag only:** `./cli-agent-runner.sh new architect -p "Your prompt here"`
2. **Via stdin only:** `echo "Your prompt" | ./cli-agent-runner.sh new architect`
3. **Both combined:** `cat file.md | ./cli-agent-runner.sh new architect -p "Context:"`

**Concatenation:** If both `-p` and stdin are provided, they are concatenated with `-p` content first, then a newline, then stdin content. This is useful for adding context before piping in a file.

**Example:**
```bash
cat requirements.md | ./cli-agent-runner.sh new architect -p "Create an architecture document based on these requirements:"
```
Results in prompt:
```
Create an architecture document based on these requirements:
<contents of requirements.md>
```

## Error Handling

All errors are output to stderr and the script exits with code 1:

- **Session name validation errors:**
  - Empty name
  - Name too long (>30 characters)
  - Invalid characters (only alphanumeric, dash, underscore allowed)

- **Session lifecycle errors:**
  - Creating session that already exists → Use `resume` instead
  - Resuming session that doesn't exist → Use `new` instead

- **Agent errors:**
  - Agent definition not found
  - Invalid agent configuration

- **Prompt errors:**
  - No prompt provided (neither `-p` nor stdin)

- **Execution errors:**
  - Claude command failed
  - Could not extract session_id or result

## Session Files

- **Location:** `.cli-agent-runner/agent-sessions/<session-name>.jsonl`
- **Metadata:** `.cli-agent-runner/agent-sessions/<session-name>.meta.json` (tracks agent association)
- **Format:** Line-delimited JSON (JSONL)
- **Management:** Fully automatic - you don't need to manage these files

## Agent Definitions

- **Location:** `.cli-agent-runner/agents/<agent-name>.json` (configuration)
- **Prompts:** `.cli-agent-runner/agents/<agent-name>.prompt.md` (system prompt)
- **Format:** Hybrid JSON + Markdown
- **Usage:** Optional - sessions can run without agents

## Best Practices

1. **Session naming:** Use descriptive names like `architect`, `reviewer`, `dev-agent`, `po-agent`
2. **Agent discovery:** Use `list-agents` to discover available agents before creating sessions
3. **Agent selection:** Use agents for specialized behavior, skip for generic tasks
4. **Background execution:** Use for long-running tasks (>1 minute expected)
5. **Synchronous execution:** Use for quick tasks (<1 minute expected)
6. **Polling interval:** Start with 60 seconds, adjust based on expected task duration
7. **Resume strategy:** Use meaningful resume prompts that build on previous work

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Discover available agents
./cli-agent-runner.sh list-agents
# Output shows:
# system-architect:
# Expert in designing scalable system architectures
# ---
# code-reviewer:
# Reviews code for best practices, bugs, and potential improvements
# ---
# documentation-writer:
# Creates comprehensive technical documentation and guides

# 2. Create new architect session with agent in background
# Use Bash tool with run_in_background: true
./cli-agent-runner.sh new architect --agent system-architect -p "Create architecture for microservices-based e-commerce system"
# Note bash_id: xyz789

# 3. Wait 60 seconds
sleep 60

# 4. Check if completed using BashOutput with bash_id xyz789
# Status: running

# 5. Wait another 60 seconds
sleep 60

# 6. Check again with BashOutput
# Status: completed
# Output contains the architecture document result

# 7. Later, resume the session for additional work (agent association remembered)
./cli-agent-runner.sh resume architect -p "Add security considerations to the architecture"

# 8. List all sessions to see status
./cli-agent-runner.sh list
# Output: architect (session: 3db5dca9-6829-4cb7-a645-c64dbd98244d)
```
